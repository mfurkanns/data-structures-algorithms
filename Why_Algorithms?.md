Why do you need to study algorithms? If you are going to be a computer
professional, there are both practical and theoretical reasons to study algorithms.
From a practical standpoint, you have to know a standard set of important
algorithms from different areas of computing; in addition, you should be able to
design new algorithms and analyze their efficiency. From the theoretical standpoint,
the study of algorithms, sometimes called algorithmics, has come to be
recognized as the cornerstone of computer science. David Harel, in his delightful
book pointedly titled Algorithmics: the Spirit of Computing, put it as follows:
Algorithmics is more than a branch of computer science. It is the core of
computer science, and, in all fairness, can be said to be relevant to most of
science, business, and technology. 
But even if you are not a student in a computing-related program, there are
compelling reasons to study algorithms. To put it bluntly, computer programs
would not exist without algorithms. And with computer applications becoming
indispensable in almost all aspects of our professional and personal lives, studying
algorithms becomes a necessity for more and more people.
Another reason for studying algorithms is their usefulness in developing analytical
skills. After all, algorithms can be seen as special kinds of solutions to
problemsâ€”not just answers but precisely defined procedures for getting answers.
Consequently, specific algorithm design techniques can be interpreted as problemsolving
strategies that can be useful regardless of whether a computer is involved.
Of course, the precision inherently imposed by algorithmic thinking limits the
kinds of problems that can be solved with an algorithm. You will not find, for
example, an algorithm for living a happy life or becoming rich and famous.
On the other hand, this required precision has an important educational advantage.
Donald Knuth, one of the most prominent computer scientists in the history of
algorithmics, put it as follows: 
	
	A person well-trained in computer science knows how to deal with algorithms:
	how to construct them, manipulate them, understand them, analyze them.
	This knowledge is preparation for much more than writing good computer
	programs; it is a general-purpose mental tool that will be a definite aid to
	the understanding of other subjects, whether they be chemistry, linguistics,
	or music, etc. The reason for this may be understood in the following way:
	It has often been said that a person does not really understand something
	until after teaching it to someone else. Actually, a person does not really
	understand something until after teaching it to a computer, i.e., expressing
	it as an algorithm . . . An attempt to formalize things as algorithms leads to
	a much deeper understanding than if we simply try to comprehend things in
	the traditional way.
